    <h2>4 Tips for Pros:</h2>
    <h2><b>1. Play mainline theory!</b></h2>
    <p>Most chess players do not understand basic mainline theory such as the Catalan opening! Playing these theory-heavy openings befuddles their simple brains!</p>
    <h2><b>2. Position, position, position!</b></h2>
    <p>It is almost certain the game will end in an endgame! That time, position is way more important than material! A King + Rook + Pawn can lose or at least draw to a King + Rook if the one playing the King + Rook has a superior position!</p>
    <h2><b>3. Time management is key!</b></h2>
    <p>Especially important for blitz/rapid specialists! A strategy to take is 'camping', where you repeatedly move a simple piece to waste your opoonent's time! ESPECIALLY POWERFUL IN <b>RAPID</b>!</p>
    <h2><b>4. Sportmanship is most important!</b></h2>
    <p>Please be a good person and resign when your opponent successfully initiates a discovered attack. No need to convulse in death struggles like a corpse with rigor mortis - no point in doing that at all, it just makes you seem like a horribly annoying person.</p>
