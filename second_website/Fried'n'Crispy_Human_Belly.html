    <h2>Fried'n'Crispy Human Belly 
        <u>AIR FRYER FRIENDLY RECIPE ALERT</u></h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Brutally decapitate a fellow human, preferably one of a healthy age but regular stature with a rather chubby belly. Gotta get those calories from them fat! 😍</li>
        <li>Create a horizontal incision from the bottom of the sternum up onto the upper waist.<b> SIZE SHOULD BE CONTROLLED ACCORDING TO SIZE OF OIL FRYER/AIR FRYER.</b></li>
        <li>Salt the meat with spices, including salt and pepper.</li>
        <li>Brush the meat with oil for air fryer, or directly place into fryer for oil fryer. Once browned, take it out and let it rest before frying it a second time until golden brown.</li>
        <li>Enjoy! 😁</li>
    </ol>
