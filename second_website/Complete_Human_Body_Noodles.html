    <h2>Complete Human Body Noodles
        <u>DIFFICULT FOR NEW COOKS! NOT RECOMMENDED FOR KITCHEN WEAKLINGS!</u></h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Strangle a fellow human, preferably one of a healthy age! Stature is not really important for this dish!</li>
        <li>Create a distal incision into the peritoneal cavity. Extract all innards, including small intestines, large intestines, livers, pancreas, etc. <b> NYLON GLOVES ARE RECOMMENDED FOR THIS STAGE IF YOU WISH FOR A CLEAN EVISCERATION OF VISCERAL CONTENTS FROM THE PERITONEAL CAVITY!</b></li>
        <li>Place a tube into the femoral artery of victim's corpse, draining them of their blood.</li>
        <li>Add agar into blood, and cool for 24 hours to make jelly blood noodles. Set these aside for a while.</li>
        <li>Place innards into water to wash off blood and excess waste material.</li>
        <li>Boil innards in clear water for 45 minutes. Remember to salt the water and add ginger, star anise, and various herbs such as thyme and rosemary!</li>
        <li>Place the blood noodles and innards into a chilled bowl. Pour a mixture of soy sauce, chili oil, and scallion oil over for taste!</li>
        <li>Enjoy! 😁</li>
